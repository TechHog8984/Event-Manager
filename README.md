# Event-Manager
## A simple LuaU event manager similar to Roblox's bindable events.
## Note: Runs best in Roblox (because of the use of `newproxy` and `task.spawn`, but can run fine in normal LuaU, given it can use `coroutine.wrap`)
## Feel free to [make a new issue](https://github.com/TechHog8984/Event-Manager/issues/new/choose) if you experience any issues or if you want to suggest anything.
